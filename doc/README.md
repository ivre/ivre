# What is it? #

IVRE (Instrument de veille sur les réseaux extérieurs) or DRUNK
(Dynamic Recon of UNKnown networks) is a network recon framework,
including tools for passive recon (flow analytics relying on
[Bro](https://www.bro.org/), [Argus](http://qosient.com/argus/),
[Nfdump](http://nfdump.sourceforge.net/), fingerprint analytics based
on Bro and [p0f](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f/) and active recon
(IVRE uses [Nmap](http://nmap.org/) to run scans, can use
[ZMap](https://zmap.io/) as a pre-scanner; IVRE can also import XML
output from Nmap and
[Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)).

The advertising slogans are:

  - (in French): IVRE, il scanne Internet.
  - (in English): Know the networks, get DRUNK!

The names IVRE and DRUNK have been chosen as a tribute to "Le
Taullier".

## Disclaimer ##

IVRE is a **framework**. Meaning it does **not** come with
ready-to-run scripts to daemonize actions, etc. You need to do that
work yourself, as it strongly depends on what system you use, your
environment, and what you want to do.

## External programs / dependencies ##

IVRE relies on:

  * [Python](http://www.python.org/) 2 (version 2.6 minimum), or 3
    (version 3.3 minimum). Python 2.6 compatibility is important to
    make sure IVRE works with
    [RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/fr/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)
    and [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) version 6.

    * the [Crypto](http://www.pycrypto.org/) module.
    * the [pymongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/) module,
      version 2.7.2 minimum.
    * optionally [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/), to
      trim screenshots.
    * optionally [py2neo](http://py2neo.org/v3/) to use the flow
      module, version 3 minimum.
    * optionally [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and
      [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) to use the
      **experimental** PostgreSQL backend.

  * [Nmap](http://nmap.org/) version 7.25BETA2 minimum (actually,
    earlier versions can be used by setting `script_timeout` to `None`
    in each scan template).

  * optionnaly [ZMap](https://zmap.io/) and/or
    [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)

  * [Bro](http://www.bro.org/) (version 2.3 minimum),
    [Argus](http://qosient.com/argus/),
    [Nfdump](http://nfdump.sourceforge.net/)&
    [p0f](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f/) (version 2, will not work
    with version 3) for the passive fingerprint and flow modules.

  * [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), version 2.6 minimum (tests are
    run with versions 2.6.12, 3.0.15, 3.2.18, 3.4.10, 3.6.2 and
    3.7.1).

  * optionnaly [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/) for the flow module.

  * optionnaly [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), version 9.5
    minimum (tests are run with versions 9.5.10, 9.6.6 and 10.1), for
    the **experimental** PostgreSQL backend.

  * a web server (successfully tested with
    [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) and
    [Nginx](http://nginx.org/), should work with anything capable of
    serving static files and run a Python-based CGI), although a test
    web server is distributed with IVRE (`ivre httpd`).

  * [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/) or another Wiki to use as a
    notepad. Dokuwiki can also be used to display the documentation.

  * a web browser (successfully tested with recent versions of
    [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) and
    [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/)).

  * Maxmind [GeoIP](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolocation_landing)
    free databases.

  * optionally [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract),
    if you plan to add screenshots to your Nmap scan results.

  * optionally [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) &
    [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (version 1.6 minimum)

IVRE comes with (refer to the [LICENSE-EXTERNAL](LICENSE-EXTERNAL.md)
file for the licenses):

  * [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

  * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

  * [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

  * [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)

  * [Linkurious](http://linkurio.us/)

  * [flag-icon-css](https://lipis.github.io/flag-icon-css/)

# Installation #

See the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file. You can also try to use
[Docker](DOCKER.md) to easily setup and run an IVRE architecture.

# Passive recon #

The following steps will show some examples of **passive** network
recon with IVRE. If you only want **active** (for example, Nmap-based)
recon, you can skip this part.

## Using Bro ##

You need to run bro (2.3 minimum, regularly tested with 2.5.2) with
the option `-b` and the location of the `passiverecon.bro` file. If
you want to run it on the `eth0` interface, for example, run:

    # mkdir logs
    # LOG_PATH=logs/passiverecon \
    > bro -b /usr/local/share/ivre/passiverecon/passiverecon.bro -i eth0

If you want to run it on the `capture` file (`capture` needs to a PCAP
file), run:

    $ mkdir logs
    $ LOG_PATH=logs/passiverecon \
    > bro -b /usr/local/share/ivre/passiverecon/passiverecon.bro -r capture

This will produce log files in the `logs` directory. You need to run a
`ivre passivereconworker` to process these files. You can try:

    $ ivre passivereconworker --directory=logs

This program will not stop by itself. You can (`p`)`kill` it, it will
stop gently (as soon as it has finished to process the current file).

You can also send the data from `bro` to the database without using
intermediate files:

    $ bro -b /usr/local/share/ivre/passiverecon/passiverecon.bro [option] \
    > | ivre passiverecon2db

## Using p0f ##

To start filling your database with information from the `eth0`
interface, you just need to run (`passiverecon` is just a sensor name
here):

    # ivre p0f2db -s passiverecon iface:eth0

And from the same `capture` file:

    $ ivre p0f2db -s passiverecon capture

## Using the results ##

You have two options for now:

  * the `ivre ipinfo` command line tool

  * the `db.passive` object of the `ivre.db` Python module

For example, to show everything stored about an IP address or a
network:

    $ ivre ipinfo 1.2.3.4
    $ ivre ipinfo 1.2.3.0/24

See the output of `ivre help ipinfo`.

To use the Python module, run for example:

    $ python
    >>> from ivre.db import db
    >>> db.passive.get(db.passive.flt_empty)[0]

For more, run `help(db.passive)` from the Python shell.

# Active recon #

## Scanning ##

The easiest way is to install IVRE on the "scanning" machine and run:

    # ivre runscans --routable --limit 1000 --output=XMLFork

This will run a standard scan against 1000 random hosts on the
Internet by running 30 nmap processes in parallel. See the output of
`ivre help runscans` if you want to do something else.

When it's over, to import the results in the database, run:

    $ ivre scan2db -c ROUTABLE-CAMPAIGN-001 -s MySource -r scans/ROUTABLE/up

Here, `ROUTABLE-CAMPAIGN-001` is a category (just an arbitrary name
that you will use later to filter scan results) and `MySource` is a
friendly name for your scanning machine (same here, an arbitrary name
usable to filter scan results; by default, when you insert a scan
result, if you already have a scan result for the same host address
with the same source, the previous result is moved to an "archive"
collection (fewer indexes) and the new result is inserted in the
database).

There is an alternative to installing IVRE on the scanning machine
that allows to use several agents from one master. See the
[AGENT](AGENT.md) file, and the commands `ivre
{runscansagent|runscansagentdb}` for the master.

## Using the results ##

You have two options:

  * the `ivre scancli` command line tool

  * the `db.nmap` object of the `ivre.db` Python module

### CLI: ivre scancli ###

To get all the hosts with the port 22 open:

    $ ivre scancli --port 22

See the output of `ivre help scancli`.

### Python module ###

To use the Python module, run for example:

    $ python
    >>> from ivre.db import db
    >>> db.nmap.get(db.nmap.flt_empty)[0]

For more, run `help(db.nmap)` from the Python shell.

# Create a view #

## Import results ##

To create a view using all the results in both databases, just use :

    $ ivre db2view

To give filters you can use the `--filters` options. For more infos
just run `ivre help db2view` from the shell.

Warning: if you don't specify either `--use-nmap` or `--use-passive`,
both will be used, and no filters means all results.

## Using the view ##

Once inserted, you can browse the results with `viewcli` as you would
do with `scancli` from command line or with Python. You can also now
access them from the web interface.

### Web interface ###

The interface is meant to be easy to use, it has its own
[documentation](WEBUI.md).

# Contributing #

Code contributions (pull-requests) are of course welcome!

The project needs scan results and capture files that can be provided
